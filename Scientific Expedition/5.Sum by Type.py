# You have a list. Each value from that list can be either a string or an integer. Your task here is to return two values. The first one is a concatenation of all strings from the given list. The second one is a sum of all integers from the given list.

# Input: An array of strings and integers

# Output: A list or tuple

# Example:

# sum_by_types([]) == ['', 0]
# sum_by_types([1, 2, 3]) == ['', 6]
# sum_by_types(['1', 2, 3]) == ['1', 5]
# sum_by_types(['1', '2', 3]) == ['12', 3]
# sum_by_types(['1', '2', '3']) == ['123', 0]
# sum_by_types(['size', 12, 'in', 45, 0]) == ['sizein', 57]
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# How itâ€™s used: (math is used everywhere)

# Precondition: both given ints should be between - 1000 and 1000
